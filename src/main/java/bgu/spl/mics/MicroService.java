 * The MicroService is an abstract class that any micro-service in the system

 * <p>
 * Derived classes of MicroService should never directly touch the message-bus.
 * Instead, they have a set of internal protected wrapping methods (e.g.,
 * {@link #sendBroadcast(bgu.spl.mics.Broadcast)}, {@link #sendBroadcast(bgu.spl.mics.Broadcast)},
 * etc.) they can use. When subscribing to message-types,
 * the derived class also supplies a {@link Callback} that should be called when
 * a message of the subscribed type was taken from the micro-service
 * message-queue (see {@link MessageBus#register(bgu.spl.mics.MicroService)}
 * method). The abstract MicroService stores this callback together with the
 * type of the message is related to.
 * 
 * Only private fields and methods may be added to this class.
